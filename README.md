 ## Use @interact function 
 Purpose:
The @interact function is a powerful tool for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter Notebooks.
It allows you to dynamically modify the behavior of your code based on user input, making your analysis more engaging and interactive.
## YData Profiling
is a powerful tool for data exploration and can help you identify potential issues with your data early on, such as outliers, missing values, and skewed distributions. This information can be used to inform data cleaning and preprocessing steps, as well as feature engineering and model selection.
